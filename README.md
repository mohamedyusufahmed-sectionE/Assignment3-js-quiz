This is a simple quiz using html,javascript and css 
use the the authentication to access the quiz: AlbutopG  12345

I first established variables to access crucial elements of the webpage such as the login and quiz containers, the login form, and feedback areas. Then, I defined authentication credentials, including a username and password, for verifying user access
Added eventlistener to validate the credentials and therefore moving to the quiz display
in the quiz section i structured the questions along with their answers and used javascript to handle user responses.
Feedback on the correctness of answers was promptly provided, updating the user's score accordingly. As users progressed through the quiz, their responses were evaluated, and upon completion, the final score was displayed
To enhance user experience and prevent multiple submissions, I included functionality to disable the submit button after use.
